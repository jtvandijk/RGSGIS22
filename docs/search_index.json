The RGS-IBG Annual International Conference regularly attracts over 2,000 geographers from around the world. This year, the conference is taking place at Newcastle University, with in-person, online, and hybrid ways to participate. This year the GIScRG is pleased to sponsor paper presentation sessions on the following topics that focus on geographic information science and tools, cartography, spatial analysis, critical GIS and related disciplines: Session 1: Innovative GI methods in safety and emergency services research Session 2: Deep learning applications in geography Session 3: Dealing with uncertainty: Quality and Representation in the context of Big Data Session 4: Ethics within GIScience, including (but not limited to) the Locus Charter The deadline for abstract submission to each of these sessions is March 18th, 2022. Further to the paper sessions we also sponsor a World Café session: Session 5: Beyond the systems of geography information Click on the link to access the details of each sessions and to find out how to contribute to the session. Please note that the RGS has strict limits to the contributions of each delegate (see Contribution limits). There is no formal limit to the number of sessions chaired or the number of co-authorships. However, sessions are normally understood as open to submission of papers. A session only composed by members of your own team is unlikely to be approved by the RGS. mappingdutchman.com↩︎ sdesabbata.github.io/↩︎ "],["session-1-safety-and-emergency-services.html", "2 Session 1: Safety and emergency services", " 2 Session 1: Safety and emergency services Innovative GI methods in safety and emergency services research Organisers Prof Vania Ceccato, KTH Royal Institute of Technology Abstract The use of geographical information (GI) in safety and emergency services research is linked to the technological development of GI-based techniques. In addition, geographical information systems (GIS) have made geographical analyses of data possible for a wide number of users, facilitating the integration of many types of data into a common spatial framework. The value of geographical analysis is becoming even greater when enhanced with spatial statistical techniques, artificial intelligence (AI) methods and new types of data, from remote sensing data to crowdsourced data. In this session, we present examples of the use and the integration of GI in safety and emergency services research. We explore the use of remote sensing data in crime research, the analysis of AI patterns of safety perceptions and the use of Twitter data in policing and emergency services research.

"],["session-2-deep-learning.html", "3 Session 2: Deep learning", " 3 Session 2: Deep learning Deep learning applications in geography Organisers Dr Stefano De Sabbata, University of Leicester Dr Andrea Ballatore, King’s College London, University of London Dr Godwin Yeboah, University of Warwick Abstract Deep learning approaches are becoming an integral part of the GIScience toolbox. Li et al. 2021 combined graph convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks to model human activity intensity including interactions in physical and social space. Liu and De Sabbata 2021 developed a graph-based semi-supervised approach to classify social media posts based on their text, image and spatio-temporal information. Palmer et al. 2021 applied computer vision approaches to the Liverpool 360º Street View dataset to explore the exposure to fast food, gambling and alcohol advertisements. Zheng and Sieber 2022 explore the interaction between artificial intelligence and human intervention in the development of smart cities. Following up on last year’s successful session on deep learning approaches in GIScience, this year we aim to continue to explore the application of these new tools in geography. Sitting at the crossroads between geographical enquiry and scientific and technological development in information and computer science, GIScience has always been a forum for both the application of new technologies in geography and the geographical critique of those same tools. Continuing this tradition, this session aims to bring together contributions that showcase the applications of deep learning tools in any form of geographic and cartographic enquiry, contributions that demonstrate novel spatially-aware deep learning approaches and contributions that aim to critically enquire the implications of the use of these new tools in geography.

"],["session-3-big-data-quality.html", "4 Session 3: Big Data Quality", " 4 Session 3: Big Data Quality Dealing with uncertainty: Quality and Representation in the context of Big Data Organisers Dr Justin van Dijk, University College London Abstract Over the past decade or so, the usage of large and novel data sources has become widespread within Geography and the wider social sciences. Where the usage of social media data has probably reached its peak, the usage of consumer data sources is now well established. Applications within the United Kingdom, for instance, range from using electoral roll data to get insight into population dynamics (cf. Lansley et al. 2019; Van Dijk et al. 2021) to using mobile phone traces to understand day-to-day mobility (cf. Trasberg and Cheshire 2021). Other popular applications are found within the domain of the sharing economy such as bicycle sharing systems (see Todd et al. 2021a) and AirBnB (see Todd et al. 2021b). Whilst insightful, there is a clear interest in exploring the quality and representation of these data sets. One of more pertinent questions is what is the provenance of various sources of these novel data sources? What, if any, is the relationship between specific data source (e.g. provision of information about travel, retail services, public services) and fitness for purpose in socially inclusive analyses? How can we reconcile new Big Data with conventional data sources? This session seeks to be a platform to discuss exactly the challenges, opportunities, and barriers to do this.

"],["session-4-ethics.html", "5 Session 4: Ethics", " 5 Session 4: Ethics How do we consider Ethics within GIScience, including (but not limited to) the Locus Charter Organisers Dr Nick Bearman, Geospatial Training Solutions, University College London Abstract This session will consider the recent developments in ethics within a GIScience setting. A major change recently is the development of the Locus Charter, an ethical framework helping to promote understanding of risks and solutions relating to uses of location data, particularly with reference to improving standards and the public interest. While the Locus Charter has been initially designed around commercial work and the public sector, there are clear applications to wider uses of location data and ethical implications of this in academia and other areas. Currently this is a ‘call for interest’ so if you are interested, no matter how undeveloped your idea is, please do get in touch.

"],["session-5-world-café.html", "6 Session 5: World Café", " 6 Session 5: World Café Beyond the systems of geography information Organisers Dr Stefano De Sabbata, University of Leicester Dr Seraphim Alvanides, Newcastle University Dr Andrea Ballatore, King’s College London, University of London Dr Phil Jones, University of Birmingham Abstract This session aims to offer a platform for discussing the current and future role of digital information systems in geography, functioning as a point of contact between researchers in digital geographies and geographic information science. The two fields and the myriad of papers, projects and tools that they generated in the past years are sometimes linked and other times separated by lines drawn by researchers and practitioners over decades (Wilson 2017). Beyond the academic discourse, our everyday life is now fully immersed into a digital environment, a network of information systems, which is becoming almost impossible to disentangle from any real or imagined pre-digital, physical world. The pervasiveness of these information systems brought us both new opportunities for co-creating knowledge and tools and a new era of surveillance and algorithmic oversight (Kitchin and Dodge 2011). As digital tools become more widely available and easy to use, we have the opportunity to critically reimagine what our systems of geographic information can be in the future. In this session, we want to invite participant to discuss the following provocations: Quantitative and qualitative methods must not just co-exist, but co-evolve within projects for effective geographic research. We can now develop digital information systems that work for all (and not the other way around) and marginalised communities in particular. We need open data, open source software and open access to academic literature to advance geography. World Café The World Café is a format designed to mimic a cafe environment to enable a better flow of conversation between participants. The session normally consists of four meeting stations / tables positioned around the room where a question or theme is posted for participants to discuss, with a facilitator and note-taker posted at each table. In an online format, think about making use of breakout rooms or similar tools within the online platform. More details can be found on the website of the Royal Geographical Society.
